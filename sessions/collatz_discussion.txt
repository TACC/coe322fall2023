================ naming

    //for loop to test each collatz sequence for numbers 1-1000
    for(int n=1;n<limit;n++){
        int i=n; //creating a new int so as not to accidentally end the loop early
        int count=0;
        while(i!=1){ //continuing until the sequence reaches the value 1

how about "starting_value" and "current_iterate"?

================ too much

void collatz(int n, int m){
    vector<int> king; // Vector to store current longest sequence
