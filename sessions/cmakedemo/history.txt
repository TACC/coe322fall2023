## create a directory for this demo
 mkdir cmakedemo
 cd cmakedemo/

## create a minimal hello world program
 cat > src/program.cpp

## also create CMakeLists.txt in the src dir
 cat > src/CMakeLists.txt

## create a build directory next to the src
 mkdir build

## go into the build directory
 cd build/

## invoke cmake with the source location
 cmake ../src/

## we now have the executable,
## here, in the build directory
 ./victorsez 

## the build directory contains temporary crap
## so you may want the install to go elsewhere:
## add a "prefix" to the cmake invocation
 cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../installion ../src/
 make 
 make install

## confirm that the executable is in the install directory
 ls ../installion/
