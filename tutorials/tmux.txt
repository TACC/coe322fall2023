Create a session:

tmux new-session -s mysession

that puts you in a session. You can now go into directories,
open editors, set an environment, and it's all remembered.

Tmux internal commands are prefixed with Control-b. Don't ask me why.

Go out of the session with `d' for `disconnect'.

Ctrl-b d

Go into an existing session:

tmux a -t mysession

Tmux sessions stay alive as long as you don't reboot.
(My laptop was rebooted 36 days ago, but before that it
was more like 200 days.)

Permanently close a tmux session with:

Ctrl-d

See what sessions you have:

tmux ls
